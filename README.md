# To Do Application 📝

- Made this app with react while learning it.
- Aim was to get a good grasp on the following:  
        - reusable react components  
        - better idea of useState and useEffect Hooks  
        - connect the parent and child component and passing the  parameters and arguments eshtabilising good connection  
        - Using the Time and data object properly that updates time every sec  
        - storing the entered data in local storage of browser which appears even after refreshing the page  
        - made it resposive.

 

        It was sort of overwhelming for beginner like me  but it  was fun creating this project ❤️
